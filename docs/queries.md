# Queries

[Home](../README.md)

---

A query is a scope, reference to data, with parameters and default value(s).

Queries are used to get values in contexts. The example below defines a query `person` with constraints `name` and `age` equal to `"Mary"` and `42`, respectively:

```
{person
    name = "Mary"
    age = 42
}
```

## Keys

Keys are the first value in a query.


## Values

Queries can have as many values as necessary.
