### Keywords

Keywords can be used to identify one or more values. **A keyword, by default, identifies one, and only one value**.

```
name "Ringo"
age 12  "About Ringo"
```

In the example above, `name` and `age` refer to the values `"Ringo"` and `12`, respectively. The text `"About Ringo"` isn't associated to the `age` keyword; it's just another normal, non-identified value in the sequence. Non-identified values can be mixed with identified values.
