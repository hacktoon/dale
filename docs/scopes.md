# Scopes

[Home](../README.md)

---

A scope defines a context, which has an optional key and zero or more values.

The key and values are references. Any first reference is considered the scope's key.

We use scopes to set values in contexts. The example below defines an object `person` with properties `name` and `age` equal to `"Mary"` and `42`, respectively:

```
(person
    (name "Mary")
    (age  42)
)
```



This can be Person


```
(name "Mary")
```



## Keys

Keys are the first value in a scope, determining


## Values

Scopes can have as many values as necessary.
