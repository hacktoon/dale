# Values

## Booleans

```
TRUE

FALSE
```


## Strings

Strings can use double or single quotes as delimiters:

```
"this string uses double quotes"

'and this string uses single quotes'
```

You can write a double-quote character `"` inside a double-quoted string by repeating the character `"`:

```
"She said ""Hello"" yesterday."
```

Strings also can span many lines:

```
"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy string of the printing and typesetting industry.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy string ever since the 1500s,

when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book."
```


## Numbers

Integers and floats are supported as expected.

```
1
-7
+99
4.535
-0.9
```

Floats support scientific notation:

```
-56.2e-5
+0.33e+2
0.7e5
```


## Ranges

Ranges are used to filter data.

```
5:10     -- from 5 to 10

-9:0

-20:     -- from -20 to last -- the last 20 items

:-20     -- from 0 to -20
```
